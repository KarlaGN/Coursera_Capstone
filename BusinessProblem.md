## The Problem
Toronto is the capital of the province of Ontario and one of the most densely populated cities in Canada. Being one of the top housing markets in Canada competition for real estate agencies is high. The ability to find the right property for the right client is key for a real estate agency to increase their sales.
 
The right property for a client is not only the one that falls within their budget, but it also should be in a neighborhood that matches the client’s preferences. For example, if a client does not like noisy areas and has a family with young children, he/she would probably want a neighborhood without many bars or nightclubs around and lots of public parks and family restaurants instead. 

This project will leverage Foursquare location and venue data to find the neighborhoods that best match a client’s preferences for a real estate agency in Toronto.
